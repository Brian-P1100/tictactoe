This project was assignment to assess to my current skillset.

When I began I knew I needed to have 3 components
1. Board
2. Squares
3. Game itself w/ parameters

I would need 9 squares to pass to the board as an array, but the squares would need to have an onClick function to handle a few tasks when clicked.
1. Record the player's click
2. toggle player
3. track and watch for winning combinations


It was a lot easier said than done. Planning and knowing what needed to be done was easier than execution. I'm still positive there was probably and easier way to do this.

There is an issue with mobile view that I haven't worked out.
